              Insomnia is more than just a few sleepless nights. If you face
              emotional repercussions as an effect of your lack of sleep then
              you are suffering from insomnia. Insomnia affects roughly 10% of
              the world&#39;s population. It is not deadly though it does have a
              big impact on your physical and mental well-being.

                <span className="font-semibold">Acute Insomnia:</span> This is
                short-term and usually happens on its own due to some
                particularly stressful or life-changing event. As you overcome
                those issues, the insomnia also fades away.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="font-semibold">Chronic Insomnia:</span> You
                might develop this disorder as a symptom of another illness,
                drugs, and other circumstances. This kind of insomnia may last
                for three months or longer, ruining at least three nights each
                week.

                  There are numerous factors that can lead to insomnia,

                </p>
                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Stress:</span> An unwelcomed
                  guest that can be very hard to avoid at some point in life and
                  is one of the primary reasons for insomnia since it can result
                  in anxious thoughts and an overactive mind, affecting the
                  ability to sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Anxiety and Gloom:</span>{" "}
                  Emotional conditions like anxiety and despair, can interfere
                  with sleep cycles.

                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Unhealthy Sleep Habits:</span>{" "}
                  Your sleep habits can also lead to insomnia. There are many
                  reasons that could lead to a bad sleeping routine: traveling,
                  working from home, heavy use of electronics before bed, or
                  enjoying or boosting yourself with coffee or alcohol close to
                  bedtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Medical Conditions</span> If
                  you are suffering from some form of illness then it can also
                  affect your sleep. Medical conditions could include chronic
                  pain, asthma, or Parkinson&#39;s disease which can even lead
                  to chronic insomnia.

                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Medications</span> Sometimes
                  the drugs that you consume to get better, particularly those
                  with stimulant effects, can interfere with sleep.

                  You can defeat insomnia by following a number of ways and
                  bringing certain changes to your lifestyle and health. You can
                  follow the tips below to get rid of this menace:

                <ul className="ml-4 flex list-disc flex-col gap-2">
                  <li>
                    Maintaining a consistent sleeping schedule. You can consider
                    writing in a journal regarding when you sleep, and for how
                    many hours you sleep to keep track of yourself.
                  </li>
                  <li>Avoiding certain foods like coffee before sleep.</li>
                  <li>Supplements and medications that help to fall asleep.</li>
                  <li>
                    Using essential oils before bedtime can also work wonders in
                    calming your mind.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Exercising regularly is a must to ensure good stress-free
                    sleep. This could include yoga, meditation, or practicing a
                    sport that you prefer.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Take fewer naps. From none to at max a 20-30 minutes nap, if
                    necessary.{" "}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Leave your phone alone! The light of electronic devices can
                    make your brain think that it is not nighttime and hence
                    disrupt your sleep.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If the insomnia persists or the struggle has turned into a
                  full-blown war, consult a medical professional as they are the
                  best person to guide you through the possible treatments.

                  As the song &#39;Let Her Go&#39; implies you only realize the
                  importance of something when it is missing or gone. Similarly,
                  many people fail to understand the worth of sleep and take it
                  for granted. Lack of sleep can have a huge effect on your
                  overall health. So, if you have trouble sleeping, don’t take
                  it lightly and work on the issue as soon as possible. After
                  all, sleeping is the best medicine next to laughter.
